## Intro from dustlayer's tutorials Episode 2

This is an intro by [actraiser](https://github.com/actraiser) from the [Episode 2 of a series of tutorials](http://dustlayer.com/c64-coding-tutorials/2013/2/17/a-simple-c64-intro) on C64 Assembly Language.

It has been ported here to be assembled with **xbbasm**, and also to be used for the unit tests in this assembler.

The resource file for the music has been manually cut since **xbbasm** does not currently support offset and length parameters like ACME.

The original code is available in:

I recommend to visit <http://dustlayer.com> to learn more and check out the other tutorials.
